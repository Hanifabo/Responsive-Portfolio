                      The Republic of Ghana was created in 1957, when the British
                      colony, the Gold Coast, gained independence, the first sub-Saharan
                       nation to do so. The name Ghana was chosen to reflect the ancient
                       Empire of Ghana, which once extended through much of west Africa.
                       Ghana suffered several coups before Lt. Jerry Rawlings took power
                       in 1981 and eventually restored a multiparty political system.
